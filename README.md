## The Goal

Practice adding styles to elements in CSS

## The Lab
The mockup you're going to create already has the html written for it, but you'll be writing the css rulesets needed to make it look like the mockups you'll see below. Each page of the magazine will be in its own HTML file and therefore have its own corresponding css stylesheet. Check out the details below to get started!


###### Experiment with these properties
* **size** of the text.
* **color** of the text.
* **alignment** of the text on the page.
* **background color** of the page.
The height and width of an image

###### Extensions
* **margin** and **padding** around text or images. 
* **font** of text.
* **opacity** of text.

You've explored a ton of fun CSS properties in this lab, but the thankfully there's even more! Pick at least three of the CSS properties listed below and find a way to use them to make your pages look even more ~amazing~. Use this amazing [resource](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) for a better idea of what the properties below will allow you to do! Scroll down on the sidebar until you see advanced css and then click on the properties you're interested in.
